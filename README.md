Rustc is known to report an incorrect coverage for some lines (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32521800/why-does-kcov-calculate-incorrect-code-coverage-statistics-for-rust-programs).
`kcov-coverage-fix` will read coverage from cobertura.xml (generated by kcov), fix it, then overwrites the original file.

## How is the incorrect line coverage detected

`kcov-coverage-fix` will mark as non-executable line:

### 1. Line that contain only closing braces or only `else` statements

```rust
if a > 0 {
    b = a
} else {  // <-- marked as "not executable"
    b = -a
};  // <-- marked as "not executable"
```

### 2. Line that includes struct declaration but not contains struct field declarations.

```rust
pub struct Parser<R: BufRead> {  // <-- marked as "not executable"
    reader: R
}
```
