Rustc is known to report an incorrect coverage for some lines (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32521800/why-does-kcov-calculate-incorrect-code-coverage-statistics-for-rust-programs).
`rust-covfix` will read coverage from the file generated by [grcov](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov/)), fix it, then outputs the correct coverage.

Though only `lcov` format is supprted at current, Another formats is going to be supported in future releases.

## Features

- Compatible with latest stable/beta/nightly Rust compiler
- Windows/OSX/Linux are all supprted
- Lightweight (small dependencies)
- Fast and safe (implemented in Rust language)
- `rust-covfix` is also available with Rust API ([Documentation](https://docs.rs/rust-covfix))

### Optional features

Optional features are available with cargo's `--features` option. You can specify the features like:

```console
$ cargo install --no-default-features --features "cli lcov"
```

|Feature name|Description|Default?|
|:--:|--|:--:|
|cli|Command Line Interface. This feature is required to build `rust-covfix` executable.|yes|
|noinline|Avoid adding `#cfg[inline]` attribute on function.|no|
|lcov|Make LcovParser available|yes|
|backtrace|Dump backtrace information on every time the error has occured.|yes|

## Install

Download the latest release from [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/Kogia-sima/rust-covfix/releases).

You can also install via `cargo` command.

```rust
$ cargo install rust-covfix
```

## How is the incorrect line coverage detected

`rust-covfix` will fix the coverage information based on source code and some rules (descrived below).

### Rules

#### 1. Line that contain only closing braces or only `else` statements is not executable

```rust
if a > 0 {
    b = a
} else {  // <-- marked as "not executable"
    b = -a
};  // <-- marked as "not executable"
```

#### 2. Module with name 'tests' are ignored

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {  // <-- removed from coverage
    fn util() { ... }  // <-- removed from coverage

    #[test]
    fn test_hoge() { ... }  // <-- removed from coverage
}
```

## Roadmap

- Support `cobertura.xml` file. (WIP)
- Add option for uploading the correct coverages to coveralls.
- Show summary of coverage difference.
